Uncovering trends between farmer age demographics and agricultural production trends across contiguous U.S.

**Question in Investigation:** Do American farmers age have any impact on U.S. agricultural economic productivity?

### Some sub-Questions Considered
- How has the average age of farmers evolved over time across county, states, and nation in the United States, from 1997 onwards?
- What are the trends in average age for the most productive coun- ties in the U.S., as measured by the dollar value of agricul- tural production?
- What about the lowest productive counties in the U.S.?
- When analyzing farm production and economic impact, how does the use of an inflation adjustment measure for the value of agricul- tural products affect the analysis?

### Key Highlights
- Cleaned and prepared agricultural census data from 3000+ counties to make it ready for time series analysis.
- Developed a Python script to automate categorization of sales and farm operations data, generating new productivity metrics. 
- Used FIPS codes to identify counties with highest and lowest farmer productivity.
- Evaluated different time series forecasting models - including Linear & Polynomial Regression, ARIMA forecasting.

### Findings
- Older farming population is most pronounced in regions where public land is more abundant.
- A significant shift towards a older farming population in the United States over the past 25 years, with the most pronounced changes occurring in regions abundant with public land, primarily in the western part of the country.
- Younger farmers are more prevalent in the more productive regions, while the less productive areas have a relatively older farmer population.
- Adjusting for economic inflation was important, as nominal sales figures can lead to overestimated perceptions of economic growth, masking the true agricultural productivity trends.

An AI-powered tool for researchers to identify optimal crops for cellular agriculture.

## 🔍 Overview

**GROW** is a web-based platform that helps climate-tech researchers explore and rank crops suitable for cellular agriculture. It leverages AI models and open datasets to assess crops based on environmental impact, regulatory feasibility, and commercial potential.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Cellular agriculture is a rapidly growing field, but identifying viable crops remains manual and time-intensive. GROW automates this, making innovation more accessible and sustainable.

## 🛠️ What I Did

- Built a backend using Python and OpenAI API for crop analysis
- Integrated a ranking algorithm to score crops on multiple criteria

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- Python, Flask
- OpenAI API
- HTML/CSS, JavaScript
- Figma
